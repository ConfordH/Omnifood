Omnifood is a revolutionary app that combines technology with a focus on consumer well-being through a healthy diet. In a world where people are often overwhelmed with busy schedules, juggling work, family, and social activities, finding time for cooking can be a challenge. Omnifood aims to address this issue with an AI-centric approach. Users can use the app to select their dietary preferences, favorite foods, and foods to avoid. The AI algorithm then creates a personalized weekly meal plan.
